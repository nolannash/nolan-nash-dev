        description: 'Note Nest is a simple app meant to assist people like myself who like being able to compare notes, all in one place simply, quickly, easily and intuitively. When you create a note you can assign the Note up to three tags which can be used to quickly and easily find and reference your notes. You are able to give a note a custom Title color and reference notes in other notes (the note text will show up differently). There are up to three resizable tabs the central tab for whichever note you are currently working on the left for searching and browsing your notes and the right for comparing and viewing other notes.',

From learning how to use Next.js, creating responsive and intuitive components using Tailwind and my first project with a NoSQL Database. After getting part of the way through I realized that my original project idea needed a relational database leading to me taking some time off from the project to learn more about cloud solutions, NoSQL databases and more.',
